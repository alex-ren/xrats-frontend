A simple Sinatra application to display ATS Cross Reference. Add a repo to to the repos folder, and add the ATS source you'd like to use for repos inside the ats folder. 

To add a repo named foo, create a folder with the code in it named foo in repos. Then place the ATS compiler's source in ats in a folder like ats-0.2.7. 

Next, edit config/repos.yaml to specify your repo's name and the ATS version used to compile it.

For any versions of ATS you'd like to use as a cross reference, add them
to config/ats.yaml.

The lib/index.rb script may be used to generate an index for Sphinx. A Rake task will be added later.
